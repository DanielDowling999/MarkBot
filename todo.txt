Enemy unit data isn't being read after first enemy is killed on 2nd map. Likely because the enemy is
the 'first', and so when he's killed he's deleted from memory. Because of the way we check for 
enemies, his deleted data would mean that the rest of the enemies will no longer be seen.
How to fix: Change how we get the unit data? Can't just do it once and update due to reinforcements
