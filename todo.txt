To do:

- Fix the path-finding so that units go after enemies out of range as well. (I'm assuming that my current path-finding attempt is only working
on the first chapter because Lyn finds a path to the throne, which puts her in range of an enemy).



Nice to Have:
- Finding in memory where a flag is sent for mid-chapter talk events. For now, they will need to be manually skipped.

-
